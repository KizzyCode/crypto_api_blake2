# crypto_api_blake2
Welcome to `crypto_api_blake2` üéâ


## About
This crate implements [Blake2b](https://blake2.net/blake2.pdf) with APIs for various use-cases:
 - Streaming and oneshot variable length hash algorithm (obviously)
 - Streaming and oneshot message authentication code (= keyed hash with secure finalization to
   prevent [length extension attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_extension_attack))
 - Salt- and info-based KDF


## Security
‚ö†Ô∏è Some words of warning ahead: This library is beta and has not been audited yet ‚Äì use at your
own risk! ‚ö†Ô∏è

However we try to do things right from the start ‚Äì this library is
[KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) and tested against various test vectors.

### Test Vectors
All implementations pass all reference test vectors and are assumed to produce correct results even
in corner cases ‚Äì we also use API test vectors to test our input validation.

### Memory Hygiene
`crypto_api_blake2` does not perform any attempts to erase sensitive contents from memory. However,
all sensitive contents are stored in heap-allocated memory, so if you're using an erasing
memory-allocator like [MAProper](https://crates.io/crates/ma_proper) they will be erased nontheless.

Using an erasing memory allocator is a good idea anyway, because Rust makes it pretty hard to keep
track on how the memory is managed under the hood ‚Äì the memory allocator on the other hand sees
everything that happens on the heap and can take care of it accordingly.


## Dependencies
Because this code implements the [`crypto_api`](https://github.com/KizzyCode/crypto_api), it depends
on the `crypto_api`-crate. Otherwise, it's dependency less.
